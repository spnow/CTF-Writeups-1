Base on check-pattern of the switch-case function, I write a IdaPython script to list all possible input that pass the switch-case check.
But there are too many record here (~8000), then they release the hint: 4 is the last argv of the hash-check function. Edit the script and execute again, i got ~500 possible input.
Just run the binary with each input, so lucky that congratulation appear after 30mins.
Still dont know what hash-check func does, wait for other writeup :D
